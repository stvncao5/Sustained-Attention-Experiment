# Sustained-Attention-Experiment
For CAB Lab

How to use:
- Download all of the scripts and place them in the same folder. (Some scripts may end up not being used due to deprecation)
- In that folder, create a subfolder called "data" and either put your own (properly-formatted) data in it or extract the data from "data.zip".
- If analysing the data from "data.zip", just run "SC_Data_Analysis.m" in a version of MATLAB that is at least 2018a.
- If analysing older data (i.e. from deBettencourt et al 2018) then run "SC_Data_Analysis_copy.m" instead.
